# Bootstrap-Portfolio - Juan Carlos Salas
Part 1 of Assignment #2

Recreated my Basic-Portfolio from Assignment #1 using various Bootstrap elements. In order to replicate the Boostrap-Portfolio as closely as my Basic-Portfolio I had to use my own CSS to override certain styles that are default with Boostrap, including adding media quieries at the lg, md, sm, and xs browser sizes.
